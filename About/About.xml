This mod allows you to demand ransom for imprisoned pawns for silver at the comms console.
It will give you a slight relationship boost.  This doesn't work if the faction is very hostile to you.  I don't know what the threshold is, maybe =>90%?
Leaders are, of course, worth more and will likely be more friendly to you after that.
If the faction doesn't take your demands seriously they will raid you.
