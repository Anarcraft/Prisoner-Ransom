This mod allows you to demand ransom, in silver, for prisoners at the comms console.
It will give you a slight relationship boost.  This doesn't work if the faction is very hostile to you.
I believe the threshold is => 90%.
Leaders are worth more and will likely be more friendly to you after that.
If the faction doesn't take your demands seriously they will raid you.
